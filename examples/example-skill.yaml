# DEPRECATED: skill.yaml is no longer used
#
# Skills are now defined by SKILL.md with frontmatter only.
# See examples/SKILL.md for the new format.
#
# Why the change?
# - Real plugins (like beads) use plugin.json for MCP, hooks, CLI dependencies
# - skill.yaml duplicated what could be detected from package managers and SKILL.md
# - SKILL.md frontmatter is the agentskills.io standard
#
# Migration:
# 1. Create a SKILL.md file with YAML frontmatter:
#    ---
#    name: my-skill
#    description: When to use this skill...
#    allowed-tools: Read, Write, Bash
#    ---
#
#    # My Skill
#
#    Instructions here...
#
# 2. If you need CLI tools, MCP servers, or hooks:
#    Create a full Claude Code plugin with .claude-plugin/plugin.json
#    See: https://docs.anthropic.com/claude-code/plugins
